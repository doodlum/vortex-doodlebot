# Testing doodlebot

Test the contracts doodlebot owns: safe isolation, startup and shutdown, credentials,
MCP transport, UI actions, and evidence from real installation and deployment. A Vortex
feature regression is useful evidence for that feature, but is not a universal kit gate.

## Fast gate

`pnpm run ci` runs types, lint, formatting, paired documentation checks and their negative
controls, unit and filesystem/process tests, and the extension build. Run it for every kit change. Tests use synthetic credentials and an
isolated lease directory. The operator's package-manager override must not affect them.

Keep boundary and failure tests: authentication/redaction, stale profile guards, leases,
sandbox containment, refused destructive dialogs, incomplete installs, failed shutdown,
cache rotation/logout, and restoring a checkout after a failed check. Test runtime selection
through a real child process and concurrent Electron resolution through separate processes.
These tests do not download tools or contact Nexus.

Human tests/benchmark run instructions live in `/docs/testing`; update those with this manual
and the source-generated package/helper references when selection or prerequisites change.
`docs:check` validates contract drift, paired change coverage and the human-only site boundary.
`docs:test` verifies stale/missing/one-audience failures and executable documentation examples.
`docs:build` is the separate strict MkDocs gate for site publication, using requirements-docs.txt.

Workflow regression coverage must exercise actual boundaries: independent commands with the
same owner are excluded; intentional nested work is allowed; partial holds unwind before retry;
known children keep protection after wrapper interruption; failed child registration waits for
exit; expired/replaced acquisitions cannot be renewed or released by stale callers. Kit unlock
requires the original acquisition ID; forced recovery still checks live operations and a clean tree.
Fixture shutdown errors preserve the app PID, profile and parent cache, and fail the run;
directory cleanup follows confirmed exit. Use synthetic
repositories/processes for these cases, never temporary edits to a user's Vortex source.

Watch tests check source edits/additions/deletions, contention without lost updates, finite
build/copy/reload guards, immutable inputs through edit/Undo, build failure and cancellation,
verified generation freshness, staged publication/copy rollback and foreign profiles at every
attachment/reload boundary. Fixture tests include rejected shutdowns without an error value.
Evidence tests
check real CLI exclusion/cancellation, source/runtime drift, applicable gates, nonempty complete
selection and changed E2E failures. A happy-path schema test alone cannot prove these contracts.
Readiness regressions also cover native producer-kit drift, provenance on every production
performance run, Vortex runtime/subject mismatch across checkouts, and skipped or TODO
scoped/control tests. Native assertion controls retain reporter bytes for each test group;
tests reject absent, inconsistent, empty or incomplete execution on either side, prove real
Vitest output is collected, and verify cancellation waits for child exit before restoration.
Retain the producing kit identity on both sides of native preflight and E2E execution; regenerate
current and baseline reports when that kit identity differs from the readiness manifest.

## Account-free real-app contract

Recorded CI at `1729a39` on 7 October 2026 passed the kit gate (675 unit tests in 58 files,
plus documentation controls), but the released Vortex 2.8.0 core passed 20/21. The lifecycle
test failed with `Vortex did not exit cleanly`; fixture preservation remained enabled.
Run [37673176382](https://github.com/doodlum/vortex-doodlebot/actions/runs/37673176382) retains
the failure trace. Its cause is unconfirmed; do not treat an earlier 21/21 at `343fd18` as
evidence that this run passed, or force shutdown/delete the fixture to hide the failure.

`pnpm run ai:test:core` (`ai:test` is the same suite) runs only the four core `.spec.ts`
files. It uses disposable profiles, games, and credentials, independent of the operator's
login. Run it after changes to the extension, launch/cache code, UI driver or deployment,
and before releasing the kit.

- Launch and clean shutdown; cold/warm/fresh profile semantics and game activation.
- No unrecoverable errors in the fixture's main/renderer logs, including rotated logs.
  Check after confirmed shutdown and before deleting or resetting each profile; a responsive
  MCP endpoint and passing UI assertions do not establish a healthy startup. Retain the
  fixture evidence on a failed health check, and skip links to unrelated profiles.
- Correct profile/debug ports; MCP tools available with writes enabled.
- Snapshot references, React clicks/input, native select, keyboard, scroll and hover.
- Real window dimensions and restoration, allowing at most two DIPs of OS rounding.
- Known layout faults, decoded PNG dimensions/content, and a fresh renderer after reload.
- Archive installation, enable/disable, deployed file contents and purge.

Use Playwright or filesystem observations to check MCP actions independently. Ordinary
assertions time out in 60 seconds; cold worker fixtures have a separate four-minute budget.
The lifecycle test sets its own four-minute limit. Restore modified window/DOM state even
when assertions fail. Performance is not measured by these timings.

CI runs this suite against official Vortex **2.8.0**, with a pinned SHA-256 installer, after
the fast gate. Update the version, URL and checksum together when changing the supported
baseline. Source builds run the same suite locally with the managed source checkout;
`VORTEX_AI_INSTALLED=1` and `VORTEX_AI_EXE` explicitly select a release instead. A green source
run alone does not establish compatibility with a released Vortex.

## Authentication and live services

`pnpm run ai:test:oauth` explicitly uses the operator's sandbox login. Cache it first with
`save-login --sandbox`. The check captures a clean profile, performs a fresh restore, verifies
access/refresh credential presence, and leaves Vortex running. It prints no credentials.
This verifies persistence, **not** that Nexus accepts the login.

`pnpm run ai:test:nexus` is a separate live-service collection check. It requires cached OAuth,
network access and Premium for unattended downloads. Run it deliberately after authentication
changes or before a release; never require an account for the fast or core gates.

## Optional Vortex regressions and benchmarks

The named `ai:test:*` scripts outside Playwright are explicit scenarios:

| Purpose                                   | Commands                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Collection recovery and Bethesda checks   | `collection-download-retry`, `bethesda`              |
| Plugins, zoom and split panels            | `plugins-page`, `plugins-mod-link`, `zoom`, `panels` |
| Multi-session isolation                   | `parallel-sessions`                                  |
| Performance/scale                         | `large-library`, `mods-scroll`, `collection-scale`   |
| Measurement without a pass/fail threshold | `download-churn`                                     |

Run the relevant scenarios when changing those Vortex features or the kit helpers they use.
Use production React for performance runs, an idle machine, explicit fixture sizes, and
baseline comparisons. Do not treat a measurements-only script's successful exit as a passed
performance test. Existing Vortex bugs may fail a targeted regression without invalidating
doodlebot's core contract. Report each suite, failures and skips separately.

## Final workflow integration

After scoped checks, run the actual CI and released-app core commands through `evidence run`,
using an isolated owner/slot and new reporter paths. Unit and core fixture environments start
their own operation contexts; the collecting parent retains protection for its known child.
This checks the composed workflow as well as the individual helpers.

Fresh QA inspects the identified diff and independently exercises a refusal or failed check,
recovery and a subsequent handoff. Synthetic repositories cover source mutation/restoration;
an isolated released app covers runtime behavior. Inspect the final manifest and artifacts,
then run `readiness`. Verify the actual final commit for publication; a previous local-diff
receipt remains evidence for that diff only. See [the manual](AGENTS.md#recorded-checks-and-readiness)
and [the workflow](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) for commands and report responsibilities.
