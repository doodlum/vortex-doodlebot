# Write a unit test

Use Vitest for logic that does not need Vortex: parsing, statistics, input validation, and pure DOM helpers. Test the behavior your caller relies on, including a useful failure case.

```typescript title="harness/src/my-parser.test.ts"
import { expect, it } from "vitest";
import { parseCollectionRef } from "./collections";

it("keeps a pinned collection revision", () => {
  expect(parseCollectionRef("nxm://skyrimse/collections/example/revisions/7")).toEqual({
    gameId: "skyrimse",
    slug: "example",
    revision: 7,
  });
});
```

`example` is test input for the parser; it is not a real collection to download.

Run `pnpm exec vitest run harness/src/my-parser.test.ts`. The full unit suite is `pnpm run test`.

DOM logic belongs with the extension's jsdom tests. A simulated DOM can check a selector or transformation, but cannot prove that a current Vortex screen has the expected control. Use [a real-app test](integration.md) for that contract.

When changing measurements, test the timing arithmetic and status handling with unit tests, then verify the actual app action separately.
