# Sessions

Import from `./harness/benchmarks/index`. The callback's `vortex` argument is a `BenchmarkSession`; do not construct it yourself.

## withVortex

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:withVortex -->

```typescript
export async function withVortex<T>(
  options: SessionOptions,
  run: (vortex: BenchmarkSession) => Promise<T>,
): Promise<T>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Starts a released Vortex with a new profile, runs your callback, then closes the app. Returns your callback's value after successful cleanup. `{}` chooses anonymous generated data and a disposable test game. It needs no installed game or Nexus account.

```typescript
await withVortex({}, async (vortex) => {
  await vortex.seedMods(3);
  await vortex.table("mods").search("no-matching-mod");
});
```

Callback and cleanup errors fail the call. Failed workspaces are retained, with their path in the error. Successful sessions remove their temporary workspace; save screenshots and other files outside it. See [the first test](../getting-started/first-session.md).

## SessionOptions

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:SessionOptions -->

```typescript
export interface SessionOptions {
  executable?: string;
  outputDir?: string;
  manifest?: RunManifest;
  dataset?: DatasetKind;
  /** Require a verified game snapshot and back up/reset supported per-user game settings before launch. */
  cleanStart?: true;
}
```

<!-- /contract -->

| Option       | Use                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `executable` | Override the released Vortex executable if detection fails.                          |
| `dataset`    | `"synthetic"` by default. `"real"` requires a pinned collection and clean game copy. |
| `manifest`   | Run conditions, collection configuration, table controls and timeout.                |
| `outputDir`  | Where to save artifacts.                                                             |
| `cleanStart` | Verify a real snapshot and back up/reset supported per-user game settings.           |

Real sessions copy the selected game fixture, but game support can also write Documents/AppData. Use a QA-only account or test machine. [Setup](../getting-started/setup.md) explains the acknowledgement.

## page and gameId

`vortex.page` is the main window's Playwright `Page`. Use locators and waiting assertions as in [UI tests](../guides/ui-automation.md). `vortex.gameId` is the active test game's Vortex ID.

## seedMods

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.seedMods -->

```typescript
seedMods(count = this.manifest?.synthetic?.count ?? 150): Promise<string[]>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Creates generated local mod files and installed records; returns their mod IDs. Mods start enabled. Use those IDs with `enable()` and `disable()`. This is synthetic data, not a Nexus download or real plugins.

## seedDownloads

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.seedDownloads -->

```typescript
seedDownloads(count = this.manifest?.synthetic?.count ?? 150): Promise<void>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Creates local archives and finished download records; resolves without a return value. It does not measure internet downloads. Other statuses need a different fixture.

## openPage

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.openPage -->

```typescript
openPage(page: string): Promise<void>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Opens a navigation page such as `"Mods"` or `"Downloads"`. Missing navigation fails. Opening a page is setup unless explicitly measured.

## table

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.table -->

```typescript
table(name: TableName): BenchmarkTable;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Returns a [table helper](tables.md). Mods and Downloads have default mappings. Plugins and Load Order need real data and definitions in `manifest.tables`.

## measure

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.measure -->

```typescript
measure<T>(name: string, action: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Times an async action, its checks and final paint; appends a measurement and returns the action's result. Keep preparation outside it. Repeated names get numbered suffixes. Table helpers already measure themselves: do not wrap them in another `measure()`.

## call

<!-- contract:benchmarks.session:BenchmarkSession.call -->

```typescript
call<T = unknown>(
    tool: string,
    args: Record<string, unknown> = {},
    timeoutMs = this.timeoutMs,
  ): Promise<T>;
```

<!-- /contract -->

Calls an [app tool](mcp-tools.md). Arguments default to an empty object; timeout defaults to the session timeout. The generic return type is a TypeScript annotation, not data validation. Tool failures throw. See [calling tools](../guides/calling-tools.md).

## assert and block

`vortex.assert(condition, message)` fails when the condition is false. Node and Playwright assertions also work. `vortex.block(reason)` throws `BenchmarkBlocked` for missing prerequisites; the runner records a blocked result.

`measurements`, `phases`, `warnings`, and `evidence` retain observations. [Options and results](results.md) explains them. Use the runner to write a report automatically.
