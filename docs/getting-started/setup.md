# Run a collection

After [getting started](first-session.md), use this guide to prepare and install a pinned Nexus collection. It uses real downloads and real game files, and can take hours.

## Before you start

- Use a **test machine or QA-only Windows account**. Game support can write Documents and AppData as well as the copied game.
- Sign in with **Nexus Premium**; the unattended runner requires it. A personal API key alone cannot authenticate collections.
- Finish the game's Steam installation and updates, close the game and launcher, and use a clean source with no deployed mods. For Skyrim Anniversary content, finish the game's own paid-content downloads first.
- Allow space for a clean game snapshot, a separate working copy, collection archives, staging and deployment. Collection files can be much larger than the game.

## Prepare once

```powershell
pnpm run setup
```

Choose **Prepare a real collection**. Select the collection, confirm the test-machine and clean-source questions, and choose the warning policy. Setup finds supported Steam games, offers a saved snapshot or copies the installed game, and opens an isolated Vortex for login. Complete the browser login when asked; an unambiguous saved login is reused. Credentials and machine paths stay in the private local cache.

A **snapshot** is a verified clean game copy that you can reuse. Each benchmark creates a separate **working copy** to modify. Setup leaves the Steam game and existing snapshots untouched and starts no collection downloads.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C1     | [Immersive & Adult, revision 104](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4/revisions/104); follow the curator's game requirements                            |
| C2     | [Gate to Sovngarde, revision 118](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx/revisions/118); base Skyrim with the four free Creations, skip optionals          |
| C2-AE  | The same GTS revision; complete paid Anniversary content, install optionals                                                                                                                 |
| C3     | [Constellations, revision 121](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/9zfscf/revisions/121); paid content and a separately downgraded verified snapshot           |
| C5     | [Night City: Femme Fatale PLUS, revision 94](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/cyberpunk2077/collections/p0qfwm/revisions/94); Cyberpunk with its required content, including Phantom Liberty |

For both GTS cases, run setup once for C2 and once for C2-AE. It can copy both variants from a completed Anniversary installation: the base snapshot omits paid files. C3 requires you to prepare its downgrade separately; setup can register the verified copy but does not downgrade it. Check each pinned curator's version/access requirements before running.

## Run the install

Setup prints the command for your selection. For base GTS:

```powershell
pnpm run benchmark -- --exploratory --repeats=1 --timeout-minutes=360 --select=B1-C2
```

This downloads genuine collection members and installs them in a new game copy, with a six-hour operation deadline. The runner loads your saved paths, checks the account and game prerequisites, uses Premium's maximum download threads and saves reports under a new timestamped `harness/.artifacts/proposal-benchmarks` directory. Choose a timeout appropriate to your workload.

Open the collection group's `results.json`. A pass requires a fully installed collection, the selected required/optional members, native completion UI, deployment and configured game-file readiness. It does not test launching the game. With warnings allowed, a resolved download warning can coexist with a pass; strict warning policy fails on any warning. Unresolved members and incomplete installation fail. Doodlebot records errors and performs no recovery or hidden retries. [Read results](../testing/results.md) explains the report.

This first run is exploratory, without an approved performance budget. For repeated release comparisons, continue with [run benchmarks](../testing/benchmarks.md#compare-releases).

## Check or update saved setup

```powershell
pnpm run setup -- --status
pnpm run setup -- --status --verify
```

Status shows detected games, cached login presence, saved collection choices, snapshots and verification dates without opening Vortex or contacting Nexus. Cached credentials and a dated Premium observation do not guarantee current server access. The second command checks every snapshot's inventory and bytes.

If a snapshot is missing or altered, keep the failure evidence and run setup to select or copy another clean source. It never repairs a damaged copy silently. Saved choices live in the gitignored `harness/.cache/benchmark-setup.json`; keep this file and credentials out of shared source and reports.

Custom TypeScript cases can load the same choice with `preparedCollection("C2")`. [The collection reference](../reference/collections.md) covers that API, custom snapshots and explicit restart/pause controls.
